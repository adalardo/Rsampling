Description: Resampling Stats (http://www.resample.com) is an add-in for running randomization tests in Excell worksheets.
	     The workflow is (1) to define a statistic of interest that can be calculated from a data table,
	     (2) to randomize rows ad/or columns of a data table to simulate a null hypothesis and
	     (3) and to score the value of the statistic from many randomizations.
	     The relative frequency distribution of the statistic in the simulations is then used
	     to infer the probability of the observed value be generated by the null process
	     (probability of Type I error).
	     This package intends to translate this logic for R for teaching purposes.
	     Keeping the original workflow is favoured over performance.
