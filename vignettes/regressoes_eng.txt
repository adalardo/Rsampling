## Installation
Rsampling is hosted on GitHub.
In order to install it, use the devtools package function `install_github`:

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github(repo = 'lageIBUSP/Rsampling')
```
Then load the package

```{r load library}
library(Rsampling)
```

## Regression examples

The data frame `rhyzophora` contains mangrove trees' measures
at reasonably unstable muddy soils.

```{r inspecting object rhyzophora}
head(rhyzophora)
summary(rhyzophora)
```
Learn more about the data at its help page (`?rhyzophora`).

### Study Hypothesis

The hypothesis is that trees at more unstable soils
will invest more in supporting structures.
One possible prediction is that the relation between the tree's
roots' torque and the investment in supporting roots must be different
for the two kinds of soils.
To express the roots' torque the ratio between
the trees' canopy and trunk was used.
The investment in roots was expressed in number of
supporting roots and its covered area.

The data suggests a positive relation between
torque and number of roots.
Plus, it seems the points of the sampled trees at the two kinds of soil
separate, which suggests a different relation:

```{r plot rhyzophora, fig.cap = "Relation between number of supporting roots and the ratio canopy area / trunk area for mangrove trees at reasonably instable soils."}
plot(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=rhyzophora, type="n",
     xlab="canopy area / trunk area", ylab="root number")
points(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=rhyzophora,
       subset=soil.instability=="medium")
points(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=rhyzophora,
       subset=soil.instability=="high", pch=19)
legend("topright", c("Média","Alta"), title="Soil instability", pch=c(1,19))
```

### Scrambling lines within the strata

#### Null hypothesis
In order to illustrate restrict randomization to strata we're testing
the most basic null hypothesis: that there is no relation at none
of the soil types.
We'll simulate this scrambling torque variable values between trees of
different soil types.

#### Statistic of interest
We have a
**statistic of interest** for each
soil type, which is
the slope of the linear regressions:

```{r estatistica de interesse rhyzophora}
rhyz.ei <- function(dataframe){
    m1 <- lm(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=dataframe,
             subset=soil.instability=="medium")
    m2 <- lm(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=dataframe,
             subset=soil.instability=="high")
    c(med = coef(m1)[[2]],
      high = coef(m2)[[2]])
}
## Valore observados
rhyz.ei(rhyzophora)
```

#### Statistic distribution under the null hypothesis

We simulate the null hypothesis scrambling the values of the torque
variable between trees of the same soil type:

```{r rhyzophora resampling, results="hide"}
rhyz.r <- Rsampling(type = "normal_rand", dataframe = rhyzophora,
                    statistics = rhyz.ei, stratum = rhyzophora$soil.instability,
                        cols = 2, ntrials = 1000)
```

The argument `stratum = rhyzophora$soil.instability`,
which indicates the scrambling of row 2, must be done within each
soil type.

When there's more than one statistic of interest, the function
`Rsampling` returns a matrix where which line is a statistic and rows
are the repetitions.


```{r rhyzophora resampling results}
rhyz.r[,1:3]
```

Values which are equal or bigger than the observed slopes seem very rare at
the value distribution under the null hypothesis:

```{r rhyzophora distribuicao nula, fig.cap="Distribuição das inclinações da regressão linear do número de raízes em função da razão das áreas da copa e tronco, em 1000 simulações da hipótese nula de ausência de relação. As linhas vermelhas indicam as inclinações observadas. A região de aceitação da hipótese nula a 5% está em cinza. Em laranja o número de valores da distribuição nula maiores que os observados.", fig.width=7.5}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
dplot(rhyz.r[1,], svalue=rhyz.ei(rhyzophora)[1], pside="Greater",
      main="Média instabilidade", xlab="Inclinações sob H0")
dplot(rhyz.r[2,], svalue=rhyz.ei(rhyzophora)[2], pside="Greater",
      main="Alta instabilidade", xlab="Inclinações sob H0")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```
#### Decision: do we reject the null hypothesis?

The observed slopes for the two groups are out of the region of acceptance for
the one-tailed null hypothesis [^4] at 5% significance level.

```{r rhyzophora teste}
sum(rhyz.r[1,] >= rhyz.ei(rhyzophora)[1])/1000 < 0.05
sum(rhyz.r[2,] >= rhyz.ei(rhyzophora)[2])/1000 < 0.05
```

**Conclusion:** the null hypothesis is rejected (p < 0,05) at both cases.

### Slopes comparison

Our main study hypothesis was that the relation
between torque and support is different for the two kinds of soils.
Assuming the linear relation exists, it may differ concerning its
slope or intercept.

#### Null hypothesis
We start by testing the null hypothesis that the linear regressions'
slope doesn't differ between soil types.

#### Statistic of interest
Our statistic of interest is the difference between slopes, which
seems small:

```{r segunda estatistica de interesse rhyzophora}
rhyz.ei2 <- function(dataframe){
    m1 <- lm(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=dataframe,
             subset=soil.instability=="medium")
    m2 <- lm(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=dataframe,
             subset=soil.instability=="high")
    coef(m1)[[2]] - coef(m2)[[2]]
}
## Observed values
rhyz.ei2(rhyzophora)
```
#### Null hypothesis simulation 
We simulate our new null hypothesis scrambling the trees
between soil types (first row on the data table):

```{r rhyzophora resampling inclinação, results="hide"}
rhyz.r2 <- Rsampling(type = "normal_rand", dataframe = rhyzophora,
                    statistics = rhyz.ei2,
                        cols = 1, ntrials = 1000)
```

#### Decision: do we reject the null hypothesis?

In this case, we cannot reject the null hypothesis:

```{r rhyzophora 2nd teste}
sum(rhyz.r2 > rhyz.ei2(rhyzophora))/1000 < 0.05
```

### Comparing intercepts:

We decide to accept the null hypothesis that the slopes are equal.
The biological interpretation of this fact is that at both soil types
the number of support roots follows the same proportionality relation with
the torque variable.

This proportionality factor is the slope of the linear regressions
applied to **all** trees, which estimate by adjusting the regression:

```{r inclinação comum rhyzophora}
lm(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=rhyzophora)
```
That is, to each 100 unity increase of the torque variable in average
`r round(coef(lm(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=rhyzophora))[[2]]*100,1)`
roots are added.

Do notice that this proportionality is maintained if we add any constant.
For this reason the linear model is expressed by:

$$E[Y] = \alpha + \beta X$$

Where $E[Y]$ is the expected answer value (root number),
$\beta$ is the slope or proportionality factor, and $X$
is the predicting variable (torque).
The intercept $\alpha$ does not change the proportionality,
rather, it only moves the line upwards or downwards.

In other words, lines with same slope but different intercepts are
parallel.
In our case, this would express that trees with the same canopy/trunk
ratio **always** have more roots at one of the soil types.

#### Null hypothesis

Our null hypothesis is that the linear regressions' intercepts do not differ
between soil types.
If this holds true, the linear regression adjusted to all data must
predict well the answer values.
If not, the points of one soil type will tend to remain under the line,
while for the other soil type they'll remain above it.

We already adjusted the aforementioned regressions, and we can add the line
to the plot:


```{r plot rhyzophora single regression, fig.cap = "Relação entre o número de raízes de sustentação e razão área da copa / área do tronco em árvores de mangue em solos mais e menos instáveis. A reta é a regressão linear ajustada a todos os pontos."}
plot(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=rhyzophora, type="n",
     xlab="área copa / área tronco", ylab="número de raízes")
points(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=rhyzophora,
       subset=soil.instability=="medium")
points(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=rhyzophora,
       subset=soil.instability=="high", pch=19)
abline(lm(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=rhyzophora))
legend("topright", c("Média","Alta"), title="Instabilidade do solo", pch=c(1,19))
```

It seems that, truly, this regression underestimates the number of roots of
the sampled trees at the most unstable soil, and does the opposite for the trees
at the less unstable one. For this reason, the residues of this regression
are positive for trees at unstable soil and negative for the rest.

#### Statistic of interest

Our statistic of interest is the difference between the
means of the residues of trees at each soil type.
The residues are calculated from the regression applied to all data:

```{r terceiraestatistica de interesse rhyzophora}
rhyz.ei3 <- function(dataframe){
    m1 <- lm(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=dataframe)
    res.media <- tapply(resid(m1), dataframe$soil.instability, mean)
    res.media[[1]] - res.media[[2]]
}
## Observed values
rhyz.ei3(rhyzophora)
```

#### Simulating the null hypothesis

We simulate the null hypothesis in the same way as before: scrambling
the trees between soil types (first row at the data table)

```{r rhyzophora resampling intercepto, results="hide"}
rhyz.r3 <- Rsampling(type = "normal_rand", dataframe = rhyzophora,
                    statistics = rhyz.ei3,
                        cols = 1, ntrials = 1000)
```

#### Decision: do we reject the null hypothesis?

We discard the null hypothesis:

```{r rhyzophora 3rd teste}
sum(rhyz.r3 > rhyz.ei3(rhyzophora))/1000 < 0.05
```

Therefore, there is one intercept for each soil type.
We can estimate them including the soil's effect on the regression adjustment [^3]


```{r rhyzophora ancova}
(rhyz.ancova <- lm(n.roots ~ soil.instability + canopy.trunk  -1,
                   data=rhyzophora))
```

And we add the lines to the plot:

```{r plot rhyzophora ancova, fig.cap = "Relação entre o número de raízes de sustentação e razão área da copa / área do tronco em árvores de mangue em solos mais e menos instáveis. As retas são regressões lineares de mesma inclinação mas interceptos diferentes para cada tipo de solo."}
cfs <- coef(rhyz.ancova)
plot(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=rhyzophora, type="n",
     xlab="área copa / área tronco", ylab="número de raízes")
points(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=rhyzophora,
       subset=soil.instability=="medium", col="blue")
points(n.roots ~ canopy.trunk, data=rhyzophora,
       subset=soil.instability=="high", col="red")
abline(cfs[1],cfs[3], col="red")
abline(cfs[2],cfs[3], col="blue")
legend("topright", c("Média","Alta"), title="Instabilidade do solo", col=c("blue", "red"))
```

[^3]: Technical detail: we add te term `-1` to the regression equation in order to
explicit to R that we want the estimates of each intercept. Otherwise,
we'd get the estimation of one intercept and the different of it in relation
to the other one.

[^4]: As it doesn't make sense, in this case, to expect the number of roots to decrease with the torque variable, we did the one-tailed test.
